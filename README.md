# GoDrive | A website for easy License Checking & Book Driving Lessons

GoDrive is a single page application (SPA) created using ReactJS. ReactJS is a well-known JavaScript library for user interfaces. The reason to use React for this project is becuase React is great in building single page application that load a single HTML page (index.html), rewrite the DOM when interact, without loading a new page (change URL). This makes the web application to be smoother as there is no waiting time for the page reload to change its content.\

Besides, code written in React can coexist with markup rendered on the server like PHP.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
